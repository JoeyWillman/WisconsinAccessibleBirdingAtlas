A short, flat trail runs the perimeter of the island, making it accessible for visitors of all abilities. The southern tip of the island features a bluff with an unobstructed view of Madison�s Capitol building, while the western bay is a popular summer hotspot for anchored boats and swimmers thanks to its shallow, sandy waters.
